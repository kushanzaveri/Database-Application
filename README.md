# Database Application

The Database Application is a program that I developed for my Grade 12 Computer Science course. The application
allows you to create/save/and open "databases", which is a set of "records". Each record consists of a full name,
email, and phone number.

## Notable Features

 * Uses Regex to error trap and ensure that the user enters valid emails and phone numbers (using standard conventions)
 * Allows users to save their databases to a file, using the java.io.* class.
 * Allows users to open existing databases and edit them within the application. The program will check that the file
   isn't corrupted and that the file has the valid extension (.kaz, a custom extension for this program)
 * Has standard File menu features (New, Open, Save, Save As) and they work as they would in a word-processing software
 * All source code is properly documented using JavaDoc standards.

## Try it for yourself

In order to test the application for yourself, you can download the .jar (below)
